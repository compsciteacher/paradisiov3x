v .3

Paradisio is a text based RPG based in the land of Paradisio. As a wayward traveler you are on a hunt for treasure, and to find out who you are. 

This is a 50x50 map with random enemies, treasures, traps, and stores throughout. Every new game a new map is generated. You can save all stats, items, and player info throughout into a simple text file.

paradisiov3.py is the actual game :)
